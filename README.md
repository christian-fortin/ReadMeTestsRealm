<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
<p align="center">
![ezgif-1-5242fb8826](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83780176/155367266-b4948399-d7aa-4961-9e3c-2d3082ac7dfb.gif)

  What is this is meant for randomness, entertainment and sharing. It is inspired by the website "stumbleUpon" which let you click a button and you were taken to a random website. I wanted to recreate that, however with a more social media feel and where users can create their own.   

**Features:**

- A register page for a user to sign up.
- A login page for a user to login to their existing profile.
- A feed page for the user to see their existing dots.
- A delete method to delete entries.
- A show card that shows more details about the dot.
- A user should be able to click on a dot and be taken to a random website. 
- A user should be able to click on the rating next to the dot and be shown more details about the item.
- A user is able to create a dot by filling in the required fields.
